If a company is hiring a **C++ Developer for a Networking Project** with **3+ years of experience**, the interview will typically focus on both:

* **C++ programming (with real-world coding)**
* **Networking concepts & system programming (Linux, sockets, etc.)**

---

## ðŸ”¹ðŸ”¹ Interview Structure Breakdown

### âœ… 1. **C++ Core (Practical + Deep Understanding)**

They'll check:

* Classes, inheritance, virtual functions
* Pointers, references, memory management
* Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
* STL: vectors, maps, sets, algorithms
* RAII, constructors/destructors
* Copy constructor, assignment operator, move semantics (Rule of 3/5)
* Lambda expressions, function pointers
* Multi-threading basics: `std::thread`, mutex, condition variable

ðŸ“Œ **Sample Questions:**

* Implement a class with dynamic memory (test Rule of 3/5)
* Explain difference between shallow and deep copy
* When would you use `shared_ptr` over `unique_ptr`?
* Write a function to reverse a linked list
* Thread-safe logging system

---

### âœ… 2. **Networking & Socket Programming**

Theyâ€™ll expect you to understand and code:

#### Key Areas:

* TCP vs UDP
* Sockets API (`socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `accept()`, `connect()`, `send()`, `recv()`)
* Server/client architecture
* Byte order conversions: `htons`, `ntohs`
* IPv4/IPv6 differences
* Multi-client handling: `fork()`, `select()`, `poll()`, `epoll`
* Error handling and timeouts
* Raw sockets (maybe)

ðŸ“Œ **Sample Questions:**

* Write a TCP echo server and client in C++
* What does `bind()` do? What happens if you skip it?
* What is `select()`? How would you implement a multi-client server?
* Difference between blocking and non-blocking sockets?
* How do you detect client disconnection?
* What happens in `accept()` when no client is waiting?

---

### âœ… 3. **Linux System Programming & IPC**

Often part of networking work.

#### Topics:

* File descriptors
* `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()`
* Pipes, FIFOs
* Shared memory (`shmget`, `shmat`, etc.)
* Message queues (`msgsnd`, `msgrcv`)
* Semaphores & synchronization
* Signals

ðŸ“Œ **Sample Questions:**

* Difference between pipe and FIFO
* How to create and use shared memory?
* How to synchronize processes using semaphores?
* Implement inter-process communication using a pipe
* Write a C++ program that spawns a child process and uses pipe to send data

---

### âœ… 4. **Real-Time Problem Solving & Design**

You might be given a mini design problem, e.g.:

* Design a server that can handle 1000 concurrent clients
* How would you structure a packet parser for incoming binary data?
* Design a logging system shared between multiple threads or processes

---

### âœ… 5. **Debugging / Tools / Build**

* How do you debug a segmentation fault?
* How do you find memory leaks? (e.g., `valgrind`)
* Use of `strace`, `gdb`
* Experience with `CMake` or `Makefile`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Bonus: Behavioral + Project Discussion

You may be asked:

* Explain a networking issue you solved.
* What part of the networking stack have you worked on?
* How do you ensure thread safety in your code?

---
